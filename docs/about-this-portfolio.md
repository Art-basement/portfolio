# About This Portfolio

Hey there! I'm Jen — a technical writer, lifelong documentation nerd, and unapologetic process gremlin.

This portfolio is a mix-tape of my best work from over two decades at The Hershey Company, where I translated chaos into clarity for IT support, consumer relations, and various business teams. I’ve written everything from how-to guides and SOPs to internal flyers and checklists that (hopefully) saved people from losing their minds.

Here’s what you’ll find in this repo:
- ✅ **SOPs** – clear, step-by-step instructions for repeatable success
- 💡 **Knowledge Articles** – bite-sized help content for real humans, not robots
- 🧾 **Checklists** – because brains get tired and lists are kind
- 📣 **Flyers** – internal comms with a little flair
- 🌀 **Process Docs** – flowcharts and markdown maps for "who does what when"
- 🧪 **Misc** – a few oddballs that still show my writing chops

### 🧠 A Note on Style

I'm detail-obsessed (hi, executive function!), love breaking things down into logical steps, and I always write with the user in mind — especially those who are stressed, neurodivergent, or just need information to *not* suck. I value accessibility, empathy, and a little bit of humor in technical writing.

I don't believe in gatekeeping knowledge. If it can be documented and shared clearly, it should be.

### 🚀 What's Next

After an unexpected layoff in April 2025 (surprise! ✂️), I’m open to new opportunities where I can help teams:
- Fix messy documentation
- Build scalable content systems
- Create resources people *actually use*

If you're into good docs, good people, and maybe a little dry wit, we’ll probably get along just fine.
