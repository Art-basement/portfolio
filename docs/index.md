# Jen Wanner â€“ Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a technical writer with a 25+ year career at The Hershey Company, specializing in clean, clear documentation that makes life easier for users, support teams, and business partners.

This site highlights my work across:

- âœ… **SOPs** â€“ Step-by-step documentation for consistent execution
- ðŸ’¡ **Knowledge Articles** â€“ Quick how-tos and troubleshooting
- ðŸ“£ **Flyers & One-Pagers** â€“ Internal communication tools
- ðŸ§¾ **Checklists** â€“ Task-tracking and training support
- ðŸŒ€ **Process Docs** â€“ Visual and structured guides
- ðŸ§ª **Other Writing Samples** â€“ Because sometimes docs donâ€™t fit in boxes
