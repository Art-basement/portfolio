# Jen Wanner – Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! I’m a technical writer with 25+ years of experience translating complexity into clarity. Most of these samples were created during my time at The Hershey Company to support IT teams, consumer relations, and internal business processes.

This site is a snapshot of my work and style — organized by content type and written for real humans.
