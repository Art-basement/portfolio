# About Jen

Hi! I'm Jen — technical writer, documentation evangelist, and process simplifier with a flair for turning chaos into clean, user-friendly content.

I specialize in:
- Writing SOPs and knowledge articles that support frontline teams
- Building scalable documentation systems
- Creating content that supports neurodivergent and stressed-out users (because I am one)

I love clarity, structure, white space, and the feeling of a doc that just *works*.

If you're looking for a writer who can bring empathy, structure, and a little sarcasm to your team — let's talk.
